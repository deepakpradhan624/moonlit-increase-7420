# Team Work Efforts:

First we created a Slack and WhatsApp group to establish communication between all the team members. Then we connected over zoom meet for further discussion about assigned project.

In zoom meet we divideed small parts of project to all the team-member, next all are collecting raw data for project which content is better to merge and easy to complete work.

Daily we connect a meet after scrum then discuss about past days work and that day work, any one have issue all the team member helps to solve the problem.

All push the data in Git-hub to their respective branch and merge to main branch.

Finally we make the presentation of the project.
